* 
* OPTIMET-3DS (Serial) is an ab-initio solver for the 3D electromagnetic linear
* scattering problem.
* 
* OPTIMET-3DS implements the T Matrix scattering formulation for a cluster
* of arbitrary spheres and spheroids on serial systems. OPTIMET-3DS provides
* both a intuitive input system based on the eXtended Mark-up Language (XML)
* as well as an Application Programming Interface (API) allowing users to design
* their own simulations.
* 
* If you have obtained the binary version of OPTIMET-3D(S/P), you will not have
* access to the API. Please contact the developers to enquire about usage
* of the OPTIMET-3D(S/P) libraries.
*
* OPTIMET-3DS is licensed under the [UCL LICENCE NAME HERE]. Parts of OPTIMET-3DS
* are licensed under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). You can find a copy
* of both licences in the Relate Pages section. You should have received a copy

* 
* To begin using OPTIMET-3DS, simply copy the executable to a folder of
* your choice. You can find a detailed documentation of the XML input system
* in the Related Pages.
* 
* This documentation also contains the API specifications. Please note that
* the API is only available after prior agreement with the developers.
